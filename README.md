# The Hodophile

What & Why

Being a hodophile myself (I just found out what the word means), I wanted to do something creative in the travel planning space. It's been too long since there has been any major innovation in online travel booking/planning. The idea I propose is an app that matches you to your ideal travel plan. Being at the ideal hotel at the ideal destination after flying on the ideal flight sounds good. One could do this for themselves, manually, but it would be a lot slower. How do I describe ideal? I don't. The user describes their own version of ideal, much like one of those dating apps where they match based on interests. 

For whom?

This is essentially for anyone. Someone who isn't into travelling could be forced into it by their partners or kids or family, but could discover a tailor-fitted vacation that best suits them. But this product isn't aimed at being just a travel product, it is convenience and it is quick. Who doesn't like convenience?

How?

The end user will be asked a series of questions on sign-up. These questions will determine the parameters on which each travel recommendation is made (these can be changed later). There are a number of ways the next parts can go. 
A: User knows where they want to travel: Yay, one step less. On the basis of their interests and alignments, the app  would generate flight recommendations with appropriate departure time, comfort, food quality, and cost-sensitivity. It would also generate hotel recommendations with approriate location, amenities, luxury, and cost-sensitivity. The list of attributes will be bigger in practice. 
B: User does not know where they want to go: Same as the above, but with recommendations on destinations. 
I don't plan on making this a booking and reservation app, but one that directly links to the place where the listed price can be found. Something like skyscanner. 

Scope

This is not easy, but not too difficult either. Addinga plethora of flight and hotel options with varying prices would require using two or more APIs. It would be time-consuming to create a good looking, fast and all-encompassing recommendation engine, but it seems achievable in a semester long window.
